    <h1>Absolute Units</h1>
    <!-- There are two types of CSS units: -->
    <!-- 1. Absolute Unit : fixed -->
    <!-- 2. Relative Unit : changeable -->
    <!-- The absolute length units are fixed and a length expressed in any of these will appear as 
    exactly that size.
    Absolute length units are not recommended for use on screen, because screen sizes vary so much. 
    That's why we don't prefer Absolute length when we are making responsive web pages.
    However, they can be used if the output medium is known, such as for print layout. -->
